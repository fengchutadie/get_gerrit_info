19471,2017-09-01 11:23:17,Daunis Pavlo,"can we rewrite this like this:

 m_cellData->isActiveVoLteSrcRate()

?"
19471,2017-09-01 11:23:17,Daunis Pavlo,"how about rewriting for-loop in this method as

 ue::DrbInfo* voLteSrcRateDrbs = &(getSlow()->drbData[getSlow()->numOfDRbData - numOfDrb]);
 for(u32 i = 0; i < numOfDrb; ++i)
 {
   ...
   ue::DrbInfo& drbData = voLteSrcRateDrbs[i];
   ...
 }

it looks more readable to me"
19471,2017-09-01 11:23:17,Daunis Pavlo,"should we check if getSlow()->numOfDRbData is greater than numOfDrb? if we are sure that it won't happen than we can add assert, otherwise - if with error-print in else-branch"
19487,2017-09-01 11:05:07,Drogi Mateusz,"I think better way would be:

20145,2017-08-31 08:56:06,Daunis Pavlo,please do not commit commented code
20145,2017-08-31 08:56:06,Daunis Pavlo,"* I wouldn't worry about this, as we are using different compilers for UT and real target, so code behaves differently anyway. the goal of the UT is to test the algorithm itself and it shouldn't depend on the fact if method is virtual or not (unless virtual is actually NEEDED for the algorithm to work correctly, than we have to use virtual in target code as well)

* regarding ""how big is performance hit?"" - it depends. sometimes it can be negligible, sometimes it can be severe. in this case my concern is not the performance, but the fact that we create needless extension point in our class just to write UT"
20145,2017-08-31 08:56:06,Piekarz Arkadiusz,I believe by using tvirtual we risk the code behaving differently in UTs and in real target. How big of a performance hit would we get with real virtual?
20145,2017-08-31 08:56:06,Daunis Pavlo,I don't like adding virtual to methods just to be able to test them. but if you 100% have to do this - please use tvirtual. it will become virtual for UT build and nothing for target build
20145,2017-08-31 08:56:06,Daunis Pavlo,what do you think about changing the method to accept Ue class?
20145,2017-08-31 08:56:06,Daunis Pavlo,"Is there any sense in expecting that mock-method will be called 0 times? you already have StrictMock, so the test will fail if there would be any unexpected calls."

thanks for your comment."
19684,2017-08-29 14:02:08,Daunis Pavlo,do we have to allocate it dynamically? won't it be simpler to just use stack field member and let compiler do the magic?
19684,2017-08-29 14:02:08,Le Bihan Sylvain,already done in a next delivery
19684,2017-08-29 14:02:08,Daunis Pavlo,I can't see a call to new in this UT. I assume it is being done inside initRadParameters();. So currently allocation/deallocation is not symmetrical. would it be better to create method resetRadParameters or destroyRadParameters which will do the deallocation?
19684,2017-08-29 14:02:08,Daunis Pavlo,"please remove those empty methods. I know that you are not the one who created it. But the original author, probably, is not working in MAC PS anymore, so we cannot just wait for him to remove it."
19684,2017-08-29 14:02:08,Le Bihan Sylvain,I do it in my coming delivery
19724,2017-08-29 12:38:53,Sikorski Mariusz,according to our coding standard we should use camelCase instead of underscores

19168,2017-08-21 05:14:26,Kan Hongquan,it's better to use the function.
19280,2017-08-18 13:05:15,Ficek Pawel,Why do you create function with same name as test just to use it once here instead of just having test body in a place where it belongs?
19280,2017-08-18 13:05:15,Ficek Pawel,So why did you create that virtual method in TesStrategy?
19078,2017-08-18 09:25:02,Daunis Pavlo,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105007/should-i-test-private-methods-or-only-public-ones
19078,2017-08-18 09:25:02,Daunis Pavlo,"1) I don't mean creating public method which will just serve as a wrapper to private method.

but public methods are calling private methods, right? so if we'll test public methods than private methods will be tested as well. in other words if there is a mistake in private method, than public method, which uses it, will work incorrectly and UT for public method will fail.

2) nothing. but consider following code

class A
{
public:
  <some methods> 
private:
  std::vector<Data> dataList;
};

what prevents user from creating instance of std::vector outside of the class? nothing, right? is it a problem? I can't see why.

Encapsulation is not a mechanism to forbid programmers to touch some part of the code. it is a mechanism to keep objects internal state to be valid at all times - only class itself can change it and it guarantees that it will change it in a valid and predictable way. 

if some other part of the code wants to reuse one of the internal structures (which also guarantee to keep their own state valid and are tested by UTs), than I can't see any problem"
19078,2017-08-18 09:25:02,Le Bihan Sylvain,"on one hand breaking encapsulation for unit test may not be the best solution, 
on the other hand adding a friend test class seems not recommanded

has anyone got a killer solution for this ?"
19078,2017-08-18 09:25:02,Daunis Pavlo,"There are two possible solutions:
1) test private methods through public interface
2) extract private methods to a separate class and make them public there so they can be tested. use this class as a private field in the original class. i.e.

class A
{
public:
  void bar() { foo(); }
private:
  void foo();
};

can be converted to

class A
{
public:
  void bar() { b.foo(); }
private:
  B b;
};

class B
{
public:
  void foo();
};

This way we can test method foo() and it is still encapsulated in class A"
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I know it was not added in this commit, but how can you know that these functions will be needed in the derived classes?"
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I don't like mixing pure interface with concrete implementation. Especially when that implementation is empty and the function is not virtual.

The very idea of a common test suite class sounds like there is something wrong with the tested class, as if there was too much common code that should be extracted to a new class and tested separately."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Because you want to have deterministic unit tests. Using randomness may trigger going through different code paths each time the test is run, changing the coverage and creating toggling results."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"If you want to test a few combinations of values, you can do that with parameterized tests. The advantage over rand() is that they are deterministic and you can check a few sets of values in one run of the test suite.

You can read about it here - https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/AdvancedGuide.md#value-parameterized-tests"
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Ficek Pawel,It is not a good idea to use rand() here.
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Le Quellenec Gurvan,Please set some default values defined in the specification document
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I can see precondition and postcondition in the title, but not the trigger. Also, it seems there is only postcondition check in the test body, but actually that function does more than that.
IMHO that function should be removed and its content moved into this test."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I feel like inheriting from TestStrategy enforces too rigid structure and hides the implementation of tests in spread out functions. The body of the test should be visible where the test is defined.

As for the title, the data in UTs is always fake or irrelevant, because we're testing logic, so ""GivenFakeDataConfig"" can be omitted. I don't like ""CheckConfigIsSet"", because it's too generic and doesn't really state what is the expected result. Moreover, the config is not simply copied from one structure to another, there are calculations in the middle of it. So the title should state that calculations are performed correctly.

A simpler title could be ""configureShouldCalculateAndStoreTaParameters"".
I didn't use words given/when/then, because they're only one of ways to convey preconditions, trigger and postconditions. I chose ""trigger should do something"" template. You can use anything as long as it's clear to the reader.

If you think that my postcondition is also too generic, you can split this test into many smaller, where each test case checks one calculation at a time. That's also another reason to get rid of TestStrategy base class."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"No, to me TODO comments are equally bad. You shouldn't write tests that do nothing, because it means you don't know what you are expecting from the behavior of the implementation.

You can look at my comment about Test Driven Development in https://ullteb150.emea.nsn-net.net:8092/#/c/19148/1/C_Test/gtest/TestModules/dl/pre/timeAlignment/TestStrategy/TestStrategyLegacy.cpp in line 43 (it seems Gerrit doesn't allow linking to comments directly)."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"checkComputeTaFilter() is empty, so this test and that function should be removed."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I don't see a reason for the empty template to exist. It looks like waterfall-like planning ahead while it really isn't clear if the current structure is fit for the future. And once the test implementation arrives, it may be too late to change the complex template structure if it turns out to be designed wrong.

If you want to work iteratively, you should create one working test with minimal test structure, then refactor and add second working test, and so on."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Similarly to above, it's not clear what is supposed to happen in this test.

When I checked the body of checkComputeTaReliability(), it turned out to be empty. Therefore I think this test as well as that function should be removed."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,Same comment about using randomness in tests as in other file.
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Sorry about double comment, Gerrit showed an error when I sent the first one."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Le Quellenec Gurvan,please try to align the = to make the code more readeable
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,From my point of view aligning with whitespace will make later refactoring harder.
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Using max() to get expected value seems strange, as if you didn't know what the expected value should be ;-). It should be removed together with usages of rand()."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Right now you check if a calculation algorithm is equal to that same calculation algorithm. It will always be true. If there is a bug in the calculation, it will not be caught, because both versions are the same.

What you should do is give the result directly or arrive at the result through differently written algorithm.

It's like testing a function int sum(int a, int b). You can test it with EXPECT_EQ(5, sum(2, 3)). Going back to your example, you can also write expectedTaOffScheMarg = testConfigData.taOffScheMarg * factor, where you would have to calculate yourself the value of factor to get the same result as with bitshift and division.

The biggest problem I see is that you first written implementation and then you are writing tests for it instead of the other way around. In Test Driven Development you first write a test, which fails, because there is no implementation. But you know what you want to achieve as the result for given inputs. Then you write minimal implementation to pass the test. Once it's done, you refactor the implementation and repeat the cycle. In short it's called ""red, green, refactor"". You can read more about this here - https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development"
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Every code branch should be tested in UTs. Then above that you can choose what levels of testing you want to use for specific parts of code.

I know the ship has sailed for the current class, but you can try to use TDD methodology to design next classes and functions."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,You copy pasted calculations from implementation for all above expectations. Same in CatM version.
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"The 3 tests above are copy pasted from TestStrategyCatM, or the other way around."
19148,2017-08-18 08:21:15,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Even if the implementation of these functions is created, these tests will still be not clear what they do. They lack preconditions, trigger and postconditions. And I believe their titles should not be the same, because as you said they will do different things."

19037,2017-08-17 10:43:26,Daunis Pavlo,"with triangle brackets you have to state relative path to file. So it is easier to understand dependencies between modules and spot unwanted rederences (i.e. including files from old file structure in new one. including scheduler code from prescheduler, ul-code from dl, etc).

with quote-includes, on the other hand, it is impossible to say if included file is in the same folder, in old file structure, in the ISAR folders, or god knows where.

P.S. of course in IDE you can just click on the include and see it's location, but it requires additional effort and is impossible to do from gerrit"

19037,2017-08-17 10:43:26,Le Bihan Sylvain,"Pavlo, can you please explain why it should be explicit constructor ?"
19037,2017-08-17 10:43:26,Daunis Pavlo,"consider having function 

void doSomething(const TimeAlignmentStrategyLegacy& param);

now it is possible to call it like this

doSomething(0);

which is in most cases not what the author wanted, because 0 is clearly not the valid Time Alignment Strategy

But it will still compile and run, because 0 is a constant used for the null-pointer in C++. and TimeAlignmentStrategyLegacy object will be constructed in place 

moreover, if someone will add method doSomething(u32 param); than the above code will silently change it's meaning and will start calling new method.

to avoid all this mess it is easier to mark constructor as explicit to prevent all the unexpected and unwanted implicit casting. it is especially true when constructor accepts pointer parameter"

Then the compiler gives harder to read errors when something goes wrong. Instead you should use a properly named constant, even in global scope would be ok."

19077,2017-08-10 16:12:13,Ficek Pawel,I don't really see a point of adding code that does nothing. Code should be added when there is a need of it.
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Daunis Pavlo,"compiler will execute base-class constructor anyway, so this line doesn't do anything, why do we need it?"
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Daunis Pavlo,why do you need this line? it seems that you are calling default constructor in a really weird way
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Ficek Pawel,After closer look it actually tests nothing. I mean - that would work even when there would be no implementation or anything in tested class. We are checking here only if something that we set in method below was set as m_configDataCatM is part of test suite - not tested class
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Ficek Pawel,"This method implementation is empty, so this tests does actually nothing. What is its purpose?"
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"As in other reviews, you could use #pragma once."
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Daunis Pavlo,why do we need this line?
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Ficek Pawel,Same like in previous file
18901,2017-08-10 16:08:14,Piekarz Arkadiusz,Nothing is tested here yet.

18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I don't understand the lint comment, configData is already a const reference."
18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I would turn the comment into a function, this way it would be more readable and testable."
18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I think these comments should be where the types are defined, not where they are used.
Also because they are plain integers, there is no checking if the values are in the proper range. The comments themselves are not testable.
I think the solution would be to store the values in proper classes which check constraints on construction and modification. The problem is more general, not isolated to this part of code or even this component."
18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Piekarz Arkadiusz,This is the 5th time I see this config data being filled in the same or similar way in this file. It could be extracted into a function to avoid duplication.
18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I would prefer comments in English :-D
I Google-Translated it to ""add"", so it seems like a TODO-style comment for not finished code.
The getters don't change the state of instances of this class, so they should be marked as const.
Whether this class should look like this at all, if it wants to be a strategy, is another matter."
18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Piekarz Arkadiusz,It's ok.
18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Le Sauce Julien,Yes :)
18571,2017-08-10 12:42:21,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"If you added the const in front of the function, then it would apply to the return value, which does nothing when returning copies (like here). Marking the function as const is done after the function arguments, like:
u32 getTaTimerMarginOpt() const

But then I checked how you did it in code and you didn't commit any changes to consts there, so now I'm more confused :-)"
18909,2017-08-10 12:38:25,Le Bihan Sylvain,line266 & 268 are both affecting configDataLegacy.taTimerMargin
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Ficek Pawel,You can write that in one line
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Piekarz Arkadiusz,Is the same object of class TimeAlignment used for both CatM and legacy UEs? Because I wonder if the strategy has to be assigned every time this function is called.
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Bochenek Jacek,No point in having this local variable if we return pointer values either way.
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Ficek Pawel,I would change name of that method and the one below from 'set' to 'fill' as usually when you see 'set' it means that you set something with provided parameter without changing it.
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I think it's not possible for this function to return null, so I would return a reference instead of a pointer.

I didn't check exactly how this class is created and used for legacy and CatM UEs, but ideally a strategy should be injected in the constructor:
- legacy-specific strategy for the object handling Time Alignment for legacy UEs,
- CatM-specific strategy for the other object that handles Time Alignment for CatM UEs.
Then constructor could store the received strategy as a member,"
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"As above, this probably should be a reference instead of a pointer.
I didn't check where the strategy is stored, but if in this class as a member, then this additional parameter wouldn't be required."
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Piekarz Arkadiusz,What does k mean?
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Ficek Pawel,"I know it is not your code, but it could be refactored and unit tested when it is here"
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Ficek Pawel,Thanks for that
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Ficek Pawel,"If you only want to access some of them without changing outside then you probably should make ""get"" methods."
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Ficek Pawel,Shouldn't it be private?
18797,2017-08-10 12:27:02,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"Can userData be null? If not, then it could be a reference, const if userData is not changed.

I would use typedefs or strong type wrappers in place of i32 parameters, so that it would be impossible to pass wrong variables there."

18431,2017-08-10 09:30:48,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"It's strange that only these two variables have comments.
Also I would rephrase in the second comment from ""TA value send"" to ""TA value sent"" or ""send TA value"".

I would extract this structure to a separate file because TimeAlignment.hpp is already big."

More generally, I think MUe could be refactored to be always valid, so there is no confusion if it was checked in some other function before. To obtain the MUe object we would need a new function/class that returns ""optional"" with either valid MUe or nothing.

18910,2017-08-08 11:56:48,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"About the last one - not only make it const, but also remove the reference.

Also I haven't seen a MAC coding standard yet, but in CPlane functions should start from a small letter, classes start from a big letter. Someone can correct me if conventions are different here."
18910,2017-08-08 11:56:48,Ficek Pawel,"Is this value changing inside that method?
If yes then I would really change its name.
If not then it would be better to do it const."
18910,2017-08-08 11:56:48,Ficek Pawel,I would move implementation to .cpp file and leave only declaration in .hpp
18448,2017-08-08 11:18:39,Daunis Pavlo,it seems that this method should be const
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Ficek Pawel,Same comments as in previous files

18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Ficek Pawel,It seems like part of test - not set up. Especially that we have only one test here.
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Piekarz Arkadiusz,Why some setup is done in constructor and some in SetUp()?
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Ficek Pawel,I don't see a point of keeping empty definition of that method.
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"void as argument is not needed.
""run"" in the name is also not needed."
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"I'm not sure I understand, I think you used ""run"" because it is present a lot in SCTs, but it usually works differently there. Functions or checks there run on the hardware for some span of real, not simulated time (unlike in CPlane).

If you want to differentiate different parts of test, you can start functions with:
- setUp/configure/expect/given for preconditions
- nothing/when for triggers
- check/assert/then for postconditions

Of course you can use different prefixes as long as it's clear what is happening in the test."
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Daunis Pavlo,"* it is preferred to use EXPECT_ macros, unless you actually need to stop test if the condition is false
* *_EQ macro accepts expected value as a first parameter and actual as a second. it seems that you have wrong order here"
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Piekarz Arkadiusz,I agree and will add that each value should be different.
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Ficek Pawel,I would set those to some dummy values to see if they are really set. Setting to 0 may be result of cleaning structure instead of setting there data with configure.
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Daunis Pavlo,"* is there any reason to put the test body inside the runCheckConfigurationCatMIsSet method, instead of placing it here?

* this test doesn't have any code, just ASSERT's, what are we testing here?"
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Ficek Pawel,Do we need that comment?
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Ficek Pawel,I would suggest #pragma once
18852,2017-08-08 09:34:56,Piekarz Arkadiusz,"You can usually just use constructor and destructor instead of SetUp() and TearDown(). Usually you can even not declare the destructor at all (the compiler will generate virtual destructor automatically, because ::testing::Test has a virtual destructor).

You should use SetUp() when you want to use virtual functions of the test suite class when building the test suite, which sounds like a rare case.
You should use TearDown() when destroying the test suite can throw an exception, which also should not happen in most cases.

currently there's too much implicit casting:
- first ueTaCeAvail gets cast to bool to be used in || operator
- second result of || gets cast to u32 to be used in the ISTRUE macro

the problem with TBoolean type is that it is not bool, but rather disguised u32. Although u32 can be implicitly cast to bool, we are trying to avoid it by using ISTRUE/ISFALSE macros"

17024,2017-07-31 07:14:59,Grobelny Lukasz,please use forward declarations when possible. they save compile time.
17826,2017-07-31 07:06:22,Le Quellenec Gurvan,change name to getMTacOpt

2nd thing is that C3_MSMC_DATA_CACHED ends at 0x18E500 so there is a hole before next section C3_MSMC_DATA_NONCACHED which starts at 0x18F500 here we can extend C3_MSMC_DATA_CACHED by this 0x1000 bytes"
17826,2017-07-31 07:06:22,Sikorski Mariusz,"and where on this wiki is written than we should create overlapping memory sections?
C1_MSMC_DATA_NONCACHED ends at 0x92300 (as before) and now you are creating next section from 0x91300 so we have 0x1000 bytes overlapping between two cores"

17232,2017-07-21 13:09:37,Alrae Leon,this looks like a method of SemaphoreServiceMemoryManager
17232,2017-07-21 13:09:37,Alrae Leon,better to convert this into SemaphoreServiceMemoryManager::getInstance so the check is moved to the singleton itself

15091,2017-07-20 11:09:12,Giannetto Diego,"Why did you add this two params? Consider that the total number of available PRBs is equal for both DL and UL. So, I think you might use the already present ""numTotAvailPrbs"" param for both cases. Do you agree?"
15091,2017-07-20 11:09:12,Giannetto Diego,"Are you sure about this initialization? Maybe you'd better to set the initial value to ""INVALID_VALUE"", adding into the .cpp file a specific if-clause to verify when this param is set to a valid value. In this way, I think it should be easier to distinguish when this LTE3128 checker is called by your LTE4040 SCT TCs."
13891,2017-07-20 11:07:12,Chen Lianbing,More simpler statement: if (ECarrierBandwidth_5MHz != ulChBw)
17283,2017-07-20 11:05:43,Kapela Katarzyna,"instead of if(!(a==b)) use simpler; if(a!=b);
But maybe we can consider removing this ""if"" or change it into assert?
Because serving cell at this moment must be set - it is set when UeInfo is created."
17283,2017-07-20 11:05:43,Kapela Katarzyna,Maybe you can consider passing SPumaUserParams instead of the whole message - this way the function will not need to be a template
16814,2017-07-20 11:00:10,Alrae Leon,Without the aligner now this entire template class CNodeSlow (which consists of only 1 public member) can be removed. Array of CNodeSlow<> can be simply replaced with array of ueDataTypeSlow.
16383,2017-07-20 10:57:04,Malecki Jakub,Wouldn't it be better to call getTransmissionDuration and add gapBetweenNPdschAndNPusch?
16383,2017-07-20 10:57:04,Malecki Jakub,"Right, I've missed the check for sequence."
13451,2017-07-20 10:55:10,Daunis Pavlo,do we really need this inline keyword here?
13451,2017-07-20 10:55:10,Daunis Pavlo,"* maybe UeIndexL2 will be a better name
* can we use UeIndexL2 type here?"
13451,2017-07-20 10:55:10,Daunis Pavlo,Xsfn should be passed by reference
13451,2017-07-20 10:55:10,Daunis Pavlo,"it seems that we are actually changing this Ue, so I think it shouldn't be const"
13467,2017-07-20 10:55:08,Pellegrini Sahel,I would prefer a more understandable formula for pdumux check duration

14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"better name, as discussed with Leon"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,describe precisely what to do - that the test should inherit from this class
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,please remove and use common apprach with inheritance of ...Setter...
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"I guess it is not needed here, you already include it in MeasurementHandlerMock"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"I think this function may just look like this:
{
return pm::agent::counter_ref<pm::agent::sum, pm::agent::_32bit>(&counterDataMap[counterId]);
}

when you call operator[] - std::map creates entry automatically if not found

But how about the other approach. Consider it.
Do not initialise explicitly the values.
modify getCounterRef() function, make it template for the type, then check inside if counter already exists in your counter map.
If not - initialise with proper value, insert to map and the return.
Otherwise - just return (as it is already initialised and may have been even changed)."
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,is it needed?
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"not needed, destructor of map will do it"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,not needed
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"is it needed?
in this class there exists mockLomAgent and IMeasurementHandler. There are some calls on them. Are they needed? I think we get get rid of this."
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"the same as in other comment - please use common approach with ...Setter inheritance.
please remove overrided methods getMeasurementHandler() from this class.
Please just have a pointer to MeasurementHandler (not auto_ptr, not static) and use getGlobalMeasurementHandlerMock() to obtain a pointer in the test.
No need to have pm::agent::CounterRecord<int32_t> TestCUlCoreCellMgmt::counterRefData;
defined in the test as we have variable defined for this purpose in MeasurementHandlerMock.
Please apply to all tests."

14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"is this instance of mock needed here, because in fact we have 2 instances in this test - this one and the global one"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,please delete it and adapt the test to use common approach - inherit from ...Setter.
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Samulak Pawel,Why test fixture class cannot derive from GlobalMeasurementHandlerSetter?
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,what is this include for?
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,please use more descriptive name e.g. initialiseCounterValues
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"please use better name, this function return counter_ref, so e.g. getCounterRef()"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"is it still needed?
You have MeasurementHandlerMock::dummyCounterData already in mock and it is even public. So no need to declare another variable for the same purpose."
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"please remove such functions and use common approach with ...Setter... inheritance;
Please apply to all UT files with MeasurementHandler"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"please just use getGlobalMeasurementHandlerMock to get mock pointer, no need to have auto_ptr here, no need for the field to be static"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,I think this file is not needed

14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"if we include this file here - please do not include it separately in unit tests, you can make sure talking with Leon"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,"not needed here, but in cpp, here forward declaration is enough"
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,we do not need all these includes? just include the interface IMeasurementHandler
14588,2017-07-20 10:53:19,Kapela Katarzyna,do we need all of this?

16102,2017-07-20 10:51:58,Lasko Robert,Why can't we reuse pucchReconfigurationStatus enum instead of adding a new field to the interface?
15490,2017-07-20 10:51:21,Grobelny Lukasz,why do you need it? you have pragma once...

15582,2017-07-04 01:38:36,Kapela Katarzyna,I assume you are fixing this because we do not really want commented code
15582,2017-07-04 01:38:36,Kapela Katarzyna,it is nice you removed default bahaviour of getCurrentCellBrowserHandle. But this function should not even be mocked! It is private and nonvirtual on the base class - waht is the point of mocking it? Please remove mock for this function.
15582,2017-07-04 01:38:36,Kapela Katarzyna,do we need this default behaviour? Or is it always explicitly called from test body?
15573,2017-07-04 01:38:25,Kapela Katarzyna,as we test just one short cycle value we do not need any exra class (especially parametrized class!). We can just have tests in TestInvalidSettingsBase
15573,2017-07-04 01:38:25,Kapela Katarzyna,TEST_P not needed as we do not need parametrised tests; two other not needed TEST_P below.

14935,2017-07-03 01:44:16,Garncarek Marcin,2) Or here should be ASSERT_TRUE
14935,2017-07-03 01:44:16,Garncarek Marcin,Due to 1) and/or 2) this assertion is still not enough.

14935,2017-07-03 01:44:16,Garncarek Marcin,userData->getPendingPdcchOrder()? MeasGap is (re)set by the test precondition.

14935,2017-07-03 01:44:16,Garncarek Marcin,why is this declared as a pointer? It might be easly created on initializer list.

I would not do parametrised test for testing shortCycle.

if (drxParams.drxShortCycle <= 0 || (drxParams.drxLongCycle % drxParams.drxShortCycle) != 0 || drxParams.drxShortCycle < drxParams.drxOnDuratT)

I would do:
1) tests for ""drxParams.drxShortCycle <= 0"" - so test drxShortCycle=0
2) test relation: drxParams.drxLongCycle % drxParams.drxShortCycle) != 0
3) test relation: drxParams.drxShortCycle < drxParams.drxOnDuratT (if possible, because I remember you told me sthg was impossible to test, I am not sure what)

The conditions for shortCycle (except 1) are in fact conditions for relations (with other parameter), so you should not set hardcoded invalid values, because they may be valid in some cases (when other parameters have matching values)."
